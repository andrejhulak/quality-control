# Steel surface shotblasting quality control with computer vision

Data:
- images collected by us at Linssen Yachts, split into "good" for "ready for paint" and "bad" for "needs more shot-blasting" (linsen_data folder)
- same images but converted to grayscale, for experimentation purposes (linsen_data_grayscale folder)
- *casting data from online, used for early experiments 

Models:
- Convolutional and Variational Autoencoders (CAE and VAE)
- Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Vision Transformer (ViT)
